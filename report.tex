\section{Introduction}

Project teams are a core part of the College of Engineering at Cornell.
In 2015, Kate Klein noted that ``a quarter of all undergraduate engineering students participate on a growing number of project teams''~\cite{klein_engineering_2015}.
This number has only grown since then:
``as of 2018, there are 29 different project teams, with over 1,100 students and over \$1,000,000 in funding''~\cite{noauthor_project_2018}.
With 3,116 undergraduate students in engineering~\cite{westervelt_key_2017}, over a third of engineering students are currently on project teams, higher than the percentage of Cornell students in Greek life~\cite{noauthor_sorority_2017}.
Despite these impressive numbers, there is relatively little literature on the history and current status of engineering project teams at Cornell.
As of the time of writing this report, the endowed position of project team director is vacant, and there is nearly no official university information about the new lab space for teams, or nearly of the many project teams formed in the past several years.

In this report, I will attempt to remedy some of that lack of information.
In Section~\ref{sec:background}, I will detail the background of project teams at Cornell, including the origins of some of the oldest project teams at Cornell, along with the creation of project teams as an official program at Cornell.
In Section~\ref{sec:timeline}, I will discuss the general timeline of project teams at Cornell, including the explosion in popularity in recent years.
In Section~\ref{sec:funding}, I will investigate the sources of funding for project teams at Cornell. \todo{is this needed}
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:cuauv}, I will delve into the history of a specific project team, the Cornell University Autonomous Underwater Vehicle team (CUAUV), to explore how rich the history is for just one of Cornell's 29 thriving student-led project teams.

\section{Institutional Background}
\label{sec:background}
While practical projects have been a part of engineering curricula since time immemorial, it has only been in the past 30 or so years that student-run teams to compete in extracurricular challenges or solve societal problems have come into their own at Cornell.

According the Rebecca Macdonald, the former Swanson Director of Engineering Student Project Teams, ``Cornell Racing is the `granddaddy' of engineering project teams''~\cite{klein_engineering_2015}. Cornell Racing was formed in 1986~\cite{noauthor_cornell_2012} to compete in Formula SAE, a competition inaugurated in 1981 in which students design and build a racecar to compete in a Formula One style race~\cite{sae_international_formula_2018}.

Cornell Racing's development mirrors that of both of the other three oldest project teams: both Steel Bridge and ACM Programming were formed as student groups competing in inter-university competitions (respectively the Student Chapters of the American Society of Civil Engineers' bridge-building contest~\cite{robert_e._shaw_jr._bridging_1988}, and the Association for Computing Machinery's International Collegiate Programming Contest~\cite{poucher_early_2011}).

While the early project teams thrived on their own, often taking top places in their competitions~\cite{noauthor_cuauv_2003}, it wasn't until 2012 that project teams took on a more official role at Cornell, when a \$5 million dollar gift endowed both the project teams themselves, as well as the full-time position of the Swanson Director of Engineering Student Project Teams~\cite{emily_hopkins_10_2012}.
This gift led to the hiring of a full-time director of project teams, Rebecca Macdonald, to supplant the part-time support that had been previously given by Matt Ulinsky~\cite{thomas_putting_2013}.

Along with Rebecca Macdonald's tenure came a renovation of Upson Hall, with a focus on increased resources for project teams.
According to a College of Engineering document on Upson Hall, ``the renovation will increase the size of Cornell Engineering student team's Experiential Learning Lab in the lower level of Upson Hall by 50\%.''~\cite{noauthor_cornell_2015-1}.
The renovation was completed and project teams moved in during August 2017, providing a significantly larger and more modern space than the project teams had enjoyed in the last several years.

Unfortunately, although Rebecca Macdonald was in large part responsible for the creation of the project team space during the Upson renovation~\cite{noauthor_q&rebecca_2014}, she departed during the summer of 2017~\cite{macdonald_thank_2017}, and was temporarily replaced by Mike Thompson~\cite{ivory_thank_2017} pending appointment of another Swanson Director of Engineering Student Project Teams.


\todo{courses taught}

``The Cornell Data Science project team will launch an unofficial student-led training course this semester — taught and developed entirely by Cornell students — to help students gain hands-on experience in the increasingly valuable skills of statistical methods and programming languages.''

\section{Timeline}
\label{sec:timeline}

\todo{Quote Alana on Hyperloop}

``Cornell participated in this competition as part of OpenLoop, a team of students from Cornell, Harvey Mudd College, University of Michigan, Northeastern, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and Princeton.  OpenLoop’s design for the pod prototype made it through the initial rounds, but the team was not able to build the pod prototype.

But in Fall 2016, Cornell Hyperloop broke off from OpenLoop, and is determined to win SpaceX 2018 Hyperloop Pod Competition in summer 2018.''
\cite{roseman_how_2017}

``While they couldn’t register immediately as a team, says Rebecca Macdonald, the Swanson Director of Engineering Student Project Teams, they were welcome to find an advisor and form a club.''
\cite{giller_openloop:_2016}

\section{Case Study: CUAUV}
\label{sec:cuauv}

``The CUAUV team, as we know it today, was started by sophomores Serguei Vassilvitskii, Nidhi Kalra, Jack Chuang, and Walter Chang in September of 1999,''
