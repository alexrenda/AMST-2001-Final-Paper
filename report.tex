``Cornell participated in this competition as part of OpenLoop, a team of students from Cornell, Harvey Mudd College, University of Michigan, Northeastern, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and Princeton.  OpenLoop’s design for the pod prototype made it through the initial rounds, but the team was not able to build the pod prototype.

But in Fall 2016, Cornell Hyperloop broke off from OpenLoop, and is determined to win SpaceX 2018 Hyperloop Pod Competition in summer 2018.''
