``The CUAUV team, as we know it today, was started by sophomores Serguei Vassilvitskii, Nidhi Kalra, Jack Chuang, and Walter Chang in September of 1999,''
https://www.cs.cornell.edu/boom/2003sp/ProjectArch/CUAUV/brainteam.org/history.htm

``Cornell Racing is the "granddaddy" of engineering project teams, says Rebecca Macdonald, the Swanson Director of Engineering Student Project Teams at Cornell,''  http://ezramagazine.cornell.edu/Update/July15/EU.eng.proj.teams.html

``Cornell’s Formula SAE Team was established in 1986.''

``Cornell participated in this competition as part of OpenLoop, a team of students from Cornell, Harvey Mudd College, University of Michigan, Northeastern, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and Princeton.  OpenLoop’s design for the pod prototype made it through the initial rounds, but the team was not able to build the pod prototype.

But in Fall 2016, Cornell Hyperloop broke off from OpenLoop, and is determined to win SpaceX 2018 Hyperloop Pod Competition in summer 2018.''
